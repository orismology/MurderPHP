MurderPHP
=========

MurderPHP is a PHP framework for bloodying up your PHP scripts. 

Well, when we say framework, we really just mean function set.

And when we say function set, we really mean that we've just renamed
a whole bunch of existing PHP functions so that they're more gruesome.

## Current Function Set

* murder($message) - like die()
* assassinate - like murder(), but quieter - accepts no paramaters
* print\_ahh() - like print\_r()
* amputate() - like substr()

## Changelog

* 12/11/14 - Added print_ahh() and amputate(), fixed murder() to avoid blank marquee and blink tags
